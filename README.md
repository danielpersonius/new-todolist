# new-todolist

highly customizable, minimal todo list, habit tracker, scheduler

I've been spreading my todo lists, goals lists, and habit tracking across multiple apps, such as Ike, Habits, Google Calendar, Egenda, Google Keep, Mastery, and SplenDO, resulting in redundant entry, forgetting to check each app, an so on.

To resolve these issues and unify the productivity process, this app will combine and/or streamline the functionalities of these apps into one.
